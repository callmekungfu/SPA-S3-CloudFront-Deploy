# Single Page Application Deployment with AWS S3 and CloudFront ðŸš€

This repo contains python scripts and CloudFormation templates that allows you to quickly set up and manage a static website or SPA stack. 

## How does it work? 
This repo contains two components:

- A CloudFormation Stack Template
- A CLI

### CloudFormation Templates 
The template will allow you to automatically create a stack including an S3 bucket to store to serve your application files and a CloudFront distribution to accelerate regional delivery and provide gzipping support.

### CLI (In works)
I am working on a CLI and some scripts that can automate some processes for the deployment and management. Please look forward to them!
